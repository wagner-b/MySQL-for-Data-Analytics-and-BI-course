/*
Because binary logs may be enabled by default, it may be
necessary to add the keywords DETERMINISTIC or NO SQL or
READS SQL DATA to avoid error code 1418. This is because
When binary logs are enabled, it will always check
whether a function is changing the data in the
database and what is the result to be produced.

Meanings of these keywords: 
DETERMINISTIC – it states that the function will
always return identical result given the same input.
NO SQL – means that the code in our function
does not contain SQL (rarely the case).
READS SQL DATA – this is usually when a simple SELECT
statement is present.

When none of those are present in our code, MySQL
assumes that our function is non-deterministic
and that it changes data. This is why error code
1418 is raised in the absence of these keywords.
