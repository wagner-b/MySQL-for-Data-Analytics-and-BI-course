# MySQL for Data Analytics and BI course
This repository includes the SQL files containing my work over 
the lessons and exercises of the course 
"SQL - MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence". My certificate
of completion of said course can also be found in this repository. 
<br>
I take no credit for the `employees.sql` and `employees_mod.sql` files 
(see license notice at the beginning of these files). 
They are shared here because they are used to generate the `employees` and 
`employees_mod` fictional databases 
(to do so, simply open them in MySQL and run all queries). 
Having these databases locally is required in order to run the code 
lessons / exercises in the other files.
